Bojang is an educational mobile application designed to teach the Tibetan language to English speakers through interactive learning methods. The app serves as a comprehensive language learning tool that preserves and promotes Tibetan cultural heritage while making the language accessible to a global audience.

The primary purpose of Bojang is to provide structured Tibetan language education through three progressive skill levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level contains carefully curated lessons covering essential aspects of Tibetan language learning, from basic alphabet recognition to complex conversational scenarios.

The app features 26 topic-based lessons that include alphabet learning, vocabulary building, numbers, body parts, emotions, animals, occupations, and real-life conversation scenarios. Advanced lessons incorporate cultural contexts such as monastery etiquette, traditional celebrations like Losar, and practical situations like ordering food or visiting hospitals in Tibetan-speaking communities.

Bojang employs interactive quiz-based learning with multiple-choice questions, providing immediate audio feedback for both correct and incorrect answers. This approach helps users develop proper pronunciation and reinforces learning through auditory confirmation. The app displays authentic Tibetan script alongside English translations, ensuring users learn to recognize and understand traditional written Tibetan.

The application is designed for students of Tibetan Buddhism, travelers to Tibet and Tibetan communities, cultural enthusiasts, and anyone interested in preserving Tibetan linguistic heritage. It serves educational institutions, language learners, and individuals seeking to connect with Tibetan culture through language acquisition.

Bojang operates entirely offline after installation, requiring no internet connectivity for core functionality. The app tracks learning progress locally on the user's device without collecting personal data or requiring user accounts. This privacy-focused approach ensures that users can learn comfortably while maintaining complete control over their educational journey.

The app represents a bridge between traditional Tibetan culture and modern digital learning, making this ancient language accessible through contemporary educational technology.
